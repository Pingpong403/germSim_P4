# GermSim
### made in Processing

Inspired by real-life germophobes, this simulator shows how some hardy germs can withstand even the best cleaning products, eventually making them useless.\n

Starting out with a germ-infested countertop, the user can click to remove all but the strongest of germs. 
Regular germs vary in color from light green (weakest) to regular green (strongest). Super germs vary from yellow (weakest) to red (strongest).\n

Even though there may be a small amount of germs after the first wipe, they'll eventually reproduce into an army of soap-resilient pathogens.\n

This is more of a proof-of-concept than anything. I wanted to see if a creature as simple as a germ could be replicated in cyber-space.
I didn't do any research for this, nor did I even complete it (what is soap?); however, it displays in full microscopic glory just how eternal germs can be.
